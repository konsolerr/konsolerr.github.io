# Flow cytometry

## Flow cytometry

* Flow cytometry and FACS are widely used techniques to capture features of cell phenotype
* Flow cytometry allows to understand size and granularity of individual cells
* FACS allows to capture protein expression for several (pre-defined) surface proteins in individual cells

## Flow cytometry

.pull-left[
* Sheath fluid focuses the cell suspension, causing cells to pass through a laser beam one cell at a time
* Forward and side scattered light is detected
]

## Flow cytometry

.pull-left[
Cells or particles passing through the beam scatter light, which is detected as FS and SS

* FS correlates with cell size and
* SS is proportional to the granularity of the cells
]

.pull-right[

<img src="Side_Scatter_Light.png" width="350">
]


In this manner, cell populations can often be distinguished based on differences in their size and granularity alone.

## Flow cytometry: example

Below are dot plot and contour plot of blood cells flow cytometry.

Such plot (and density plots) are common for flow cytometry and FACS and allow cell subset identification.

# FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting)

## FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting)

* FACS adds another functionality to flow cytometry
* FACS detects expression of cell surface molecules
* For FACS we need to design panel of antibodies with specific fluorophores

## Cell surface molecules

There are many cell surface molecules and ost of them have at least two names:

1. **Functional**: <br> PTPRC (Protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, C) <br> ITGAM (Integrin alpha M)
2. **Cluster of differentiation**: <br>  CD45, CD11b

Sometimes these genes have just a name of CD nomenclature like CD4 and CD34.

## Cell surface molecules

Cell surface molecules may be protein complexes: i.e. composed of products of several genes.

## Cell surface molecules

.pull-left[

* Luckily, we don't need to learn them
* Takeaway message: there are **many** cell surface molecules, and scientists very often use them to **characterize cell types**

## Antibodies

* An **antibody** (**Ab**), also known as an **immunoglobulin** (**Ig**), is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses
* The antibody **recognizes a unique molecule**, called an antigen, and **binds** to it
* We can engineer antibodies for cell surface molecules
