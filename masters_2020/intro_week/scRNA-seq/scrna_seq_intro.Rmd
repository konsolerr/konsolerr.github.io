## Why single-cell RNA-seq


Heterogenous populations:
* New cell subpopulations discovery
* Comparison of similar cell subpopulations
* Marker selection for cell subpopulations

Homogenous populations:
* Understanding heterogeneity
* Cellular states and cellular processes

Tracking of cell differentiation

## Main challenges

* **How to amplify and sequence small number of RNA (typical mammalian cell has only 200 000 mRNA molecules)?**
* How to isolate cells?
* How to work with big number of cells?

---


## Low library complexity

* Small numbers of mRNA molecules yield low complexity cDNA library
* cDNA molecules to be amplified by PCR
* We don’t want to sequence tons of PCR duplicates

## Understaing what's noise

## Understaing what's noise

There is cell-free RNA in the cellular suspension that will be captured in empty droplets (with beads), and we must distinguish cells from empty droplets:

* We can set a hard threshold on UMI to filter noise from actual cells
* We can calculate noise signature and test every cell against this signature (emptyDrops, https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1662-y)

---

## SCN: single-cell navigator

* In our lab we develop tools to visualize single-cell expression data
* scNavigator currently has many public datasets (and will have even more)
* For now we only need our "toy" dataset, follow the link below

https://artyomovlab.wustl.edu/scn/?token=10x_5k_pbmc

---

## Basic steps to analysis of scRNA-seq

* Filtering out “bad” barcodes
* Normalizing expression levels: (scaling and log2 normalizing)
* PCA
* Visualization (tSNE or UMAP)
* Clustering
* Cellular subset annotation

---

## What is count matrix

Count matrix is large:

* 33538 genes 
* 5155 cells

---


## Normalization (old way)

* Scaling expression to 10 000 UMIs (instead of million in RPM)
* Finding features with high variance (features above mean/variance trend)
* Scaling data (for PCA and so on)

* **PCA**
* Visualization (tSNE or UMAP)
* Clustering
* Cellular subset annotation

## High-dimensionality of scRNA-seq

Initially matrix is very large in size, this causes different kind of issues:

* Some algorithms are just slow when performed in this high-dimensionality data
* Curse of dimensionality

We usually take several steps to reduce dims before creating 2d clustered map of our dataset

* Keeping only variable genes (since those introduce variance to the dataset)
* PCA will reduce dimensionality to 20-30 first components

---

## Visualization

Both tSNE and UMAP will put our data after PCA into a 2D plane:
* Dots that are close to each other are cells that are transcriptionally similar to each other
* Dots that are far from each other are cells that are trasncriptionally diffirent from each other

Lets look at dimensionality of each cell:
* Variable genes only: 30k+ -> 2-3k of variable genes
* PCA: 2-3k of variable genes -> 20-30 principal components
* tSNE or UMAP: 20-30 PCs -> 2d or 3d plots

---

## tSNE

tSNE - "t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets"

* We can calculate distances in original space, and then calculate conditional probabilities $p_{i| j}$ that point $i$ would choose point $j$ as a neighbor. $p_{i| j}$  are proportional to "distances" from $i$ to all other points (actually probability density around point $i$, but it doesn't matter here).
* Once all $p_{i, j}$ are calculated in original space we try to find such 2d/3d space that would have similar probabilities

## Basic steps to analysis of scRNA-seq

* Filtering out “bad” barcodes
* Normalizing expression levels: (scaling and log2 normalizing)
* PCA
* Visualization (tSNE or UMAP)
* **Clustering**
* Cellular subset annotation

---

## Clustering and annotation

Clustering:
* Graph-based clustering (preferred)
* K-means 

Annotation:
* First, check known markers
* For each cluster, perform differential expression: cluster against all others
* Top DE genes exprected to be highly distinctive marker genes

---

## Clustering

.pull-left[
* Instead of defining clusters based on distance we first find “shared nearest neighbors"
* Cells that have a lot of neighbors in common, most likely “live in the same neighborhood”
* Algorithm is trying to find such neighborhoods

## Annotation

Known markers: CD14, CD79A, CD3D are known markers of Monocytes, B cells and T cells respectively

---
## Communication is important

* When clusters are found we want to identify which cell subsets are presented, to “annotate” them
* If you are a bioinformatician and you are a single-cell RNA-seq dataset that have been designed/done by you, this is a perfect to time to go and talk to a biologist who performed/designed the experiment
* If you are a biologist who designed/performed single-cell RNA-seq experiment, chances are, you know all cellular subsets and markers better than almost anyone else
* This is where you communicate and try to make sense of the data
