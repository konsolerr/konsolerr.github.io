# Flow cytometry

---


## Flow cytometry

* Flow cytometry and FACS are widely used techniques to capture features of cell phenotype
* Flow cytometry allows to understand size and granularity of individual cells
* FACS allows to capture protein expression for several (pre-defined) surface proteins in individual cells

---

## Flow cytometry

.pull-left[
* Sheath fluid focuses the cell suspension, causing cells to pass through a laser beam one cell at a time
* Forward and side scattered light is detected

## Flow cytometry

.pull-left[
Cells or particles passing through the beam scatter light, which is detected as FS and SS

* FS correlates with cell size and
* SS is proportional to the granularity of the cells
]

.pull-right[

<img src="Side_Scatter_Light.png" width="350">
]


In this manner, cell populations can often be distinguished based on differences in their size and granularity alone.

## Flow cytometry: example

Below are dot plot and contour plot of blood cells flow cytometry.

Such plot (and density plots) are common for flow cytometry and FACS and allow cell subset identification.

# FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting)

---

## FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting)

* FACS adds another functionality to flow cytometry
* FACS detects expression of cell surface molecules
* For FACS we need to design panel of antibodies with specific fluorophores

## Cell surface molecules

There are many cell surface molecules and ost of them have at least two names:

1. **Functional**: <br> PTPRC (Protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, C) <br> ITGAM (Integrin alpha M)
2. **Cluster of differentiation**: <br>  CD45, CD11b

Sometimes these genes have just a name of CD nomenclature like CD4 and CD34.

## Cell surface molecules

Cell surface molecules may be protein complexes: i.e. composed of products of several genes.

## Cell surface molecules

.pull-left[

* Luckily, we don't need to learn them
* Takeaway message: there are **many** cell surface molecules, and scientists very often use them to **characterize cell types**

## Antibodies

* An **antibody** (**Ab**), also known as an **immunoglobulin** (**Ig**), is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses
* The antibody **recognizes a unique molecule**, called an antigen, and **binds** to it
* We can engineer antibodies for cell surface molecules


<div class="my-footer"><span>Definition is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody</span></div>

## Antibodies

* We can attach fluorophores of different colors to antibodies to figure measure the expression of surface markers in individual cells

## Fluorophores

* There are many fluoroscent molecules (fluorophores)
* These fluorescent molecules are excited by laser light at specific wavelengths and then emit light (fluoresce) at another wavelength
* By conjugating (pre-attaching) them to primary antibodies, we can create conjugated antibodies that allow for flow cytometry analysis

## Important properties of fluorophores

.tiny[
* **Maximum Excitation Wavelength (λex)** – The peak wavelength in the excitation (absorption) spectra, measured in nanometers (nm)
* **Maximum Emission Wavelength (λem)** – The peak wavelength in the emission spectra, measured in nanometers (nm)
* **Extinction Coefficient (ε max )** – (also called molar absorptivity) The capacity for the fluorochrome to absorb light at a given wavelength, usually measured at the maximum excitation wavelength with the units M −1 cm −1
* **Fluorescence Quantum Yield** (Φf) – The number of photons emitted per absorbed photon. A high quantum yield is important, and this number ranges between 0 and 1
* **Brightness** – The fluorescence output per fluorophore measured. Fluorophores with high brightness values can be used to detect lower-abundance targets. Calculated as the product of the extinction coefficient (at the relevant excitation wavelength) and the fluorescence quantum yield divided by 1000, with the units M −1 cm −1

## Quick reminder about photon energy

$$ E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} $$
Where
* $h$ is Planck constant
* $c$ is the speed of light (in vacuum)
* $\lambda$ is the photon wavelength

**Energy** of emitted photon **is always lower** than the energy of absorbed photon, so **wavelength** of emitted photon **is greater** than the wavelaength of absorbed photon.

## Flow cytometry with fluorescence

.pull-left[

* So we have cell labeled with antibodies
* Antibodies for different surface molecules have different fluorophores
* **For each cell** we detect **forward scatter**, **side scatter** and **fluorescence**

## FACS

* Unfortunately, emission light spectra overlap between similar colors
* We are limited to **7-10** antibodies per FACS experiment

When you are only given 4 flurophores, how to chose to which antibodies to conjugate?

* Basic rule: lower average expression -> greater fluorohpore brightness

## FACS: sorting cells

.pull-left[

* We can charge droplets with cells based on their fluorescence
* We can put magnets that will pull differently droplets with different fluorescence into different flasks
* That's called sorting

## Lets interpret some FACS plots

* With this knowledge about FACS and how FACS plots look like it should be much easier for you to read and look at different biological papers (especially immunological)
* Let's open Figure 1 from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-019-0449-3.pdf
