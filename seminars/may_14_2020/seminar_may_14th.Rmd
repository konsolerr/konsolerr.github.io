# Quick intro to scRNA-seq

---

## Cell is the fundamental unit

* Microscopy
* FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting)
* CyTOF (Cytometry by Time Of Flight)
* scRNA-seq (single-cell RNA-seq)
* Single cell genomics and epigenetics
---

## Single cell RNA-seq

.pull-left[
* RNA-seq is a snapshot of what is happening in the sample
* Sample consistss of many different cells and cell types
* Single-cell RNA-seq - thousand of individual snapshots of many cells to capture the whole picture
]
.pull-right[

## Why single-cell RNA-seq


Heterogenous populations:
* New cell subpopulations discovery
* Comparison of similar cell subpopulations
* Marker selection for cell subpopulations

Homogenous populations:
* Understanding heterogeneity
* Cellular states and cellular processes

Tracking of cell differentiation

# scNavigator

---

## Working with public datasets can be easy

https://artyomovlab.wustl.edu/scn/

* Initially we created scNavigator (back in the days single-cell explorer) to make life a bit easier
* Remove a person between a biologists and their data
* We wanted to be able to visualize and easily interpet scRNA-seq data


---

## scNavigator today

* Visualization web browser
* Large database of processed scRNA-seq datasets (kudos to Masha Firuleva)
* Signature search

---

## scNavigator today

* **Visualization web browser**
* Large database of processed scRNA-seq datasets (kudos to Masha Firuleva)
* Signature search

---

## scNavigator: visualization

Link to play with

https://artyomovlab.wustl.edu/scn/?token=10x_5k_pbmc

* Clustering, dim reductions, scatter plots
* Plots to show expressions (scatter plots and violin plots)
* Plots to show summarized pathway expression
* Markers tab: very easy way to check out markers and visualize their expression
* Filtering: you can only work with the cells you want to

---

## scNavigator features

* It is in **web**, you can send link with the dataset to your collaborators
* Most of the plotting done in the client (which means we can have many users accessing data in the same time)
* Web means we can cache the data that requested often
* It is fast and convenient (fast is objective, convenient is subjective)

## Public datasets

Two main sources

* NCBI GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
* EMBL EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute, part of EMBL, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)

---

## Current database snapshot

Total 2022 single-cell datasets (as of today)

* From which 60% mouse, 38% human and 2% rat
* From which 66% 10x (mostly v2), 31% DropSeq, 2% inDrops

Here we calculated samples (like GSM or SAMEA, as well as merged GSEs)

---

## Current database progress 

When we try to estimate current progress of obtaining all the single-cell RNA-seq datasets from the public databases we see this

* GEO: 277 GSE from 1100 (27%)
* MTAB: 36 MTAB IDs of 150 (24%)
* Many of this datasets have multiple samples, that's why ~300 dataset IDs produce around 2000 different single-cell datasets.

Why is that?

---

## Progress with major technologies

* 10x: 221 of 420
* DropSeq: 76 of 85
* inDrops: 2 from 29

However many datasets are from other technologies like Fluidigm, CEL-seq, Smart(2)-seq and so on. 

Some of these datasets have to processed as bulk RNA-seq (to get the tables) and then pipeline have to be adjusted to process them differently.

## How do we process single-cell RNA-seq

<div class="my-footer"><span>https://github.com/pachterlab/kallistobustools</span></div>
---

## Seurat analysis

Seurat is an R package for analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data

* Normalization
* Some more QC: removing cells with high mito-content
* (if dataset consists of multiple samples) merging samples together
* Dimensionality reductions: both tSNE and UMAP
* Clustering
* Markers identification

## scNavigator today

* Visualization web browser
* Large database of processed scRNA-seq datasets (kudos to Masha Firuleva)
* **Signature search**

---

## GeneQuery inspired gene signature search

* Previously we had Boris talk epxlaining GeneQuery
* Having this large database of public scRNA-seq datasets we wanted to implement gene signature search
* Given with a list of gene, we can match it against markers of all the clusters present in our database

---

## Quick note: how we get the markers

Differential epxression (DE)

.pull-left[
<img src="clusters.png" width="70%">
]

.pull-right[
<img src="markers.png" width="70%">
]

---

## DE

* For each cluster we run differential expression test of this cluster against all other clusters

```{r }
data <- read.csv2("~/Downloads/markers (11).csv", sep=",")
head(data)
```


---

## Current stage

.pull-left[
* Let $N$ be the number of datasets
* $U_i$ is a set of genes expressed in a dataset $i$
* $U_0 = \cup_i^{N} U_i$
* $M_{i, j}$ is a set of markers of cluster $j$ in dataset $i$
]

.pull-right[
<img src="what_is_database.png" width="80%">
]

---

## Statistical framework is hypergeometric test

* Let $Q$ be the gene set from the query
* For each module $M_{i,j}$ we will calculate

$$ Q\_m = Q \cap M\_{i, j} \ \ \ \ \   Q\_u = Q \cap U\_i$$
* Genes from module $|M_{i,j}|$ are red balls and other genes $|U_i - M_{i, j}|$ from universe are white balls
* We draw $|Q_u|$ balls from the urn (without replacement) and get $|Q_m|$ red balls
* Hypergeometric test can tell how likely we can get this many red balls if we draw them randomly

---

## Statistical framework

* Hypergeometric test will generate p values
* P values will be corrected for multiple hypotheses
* Significant hits returned to the user
* See the example

---

## What can be interesting?

* **How genes in universes overlap with each other?**
* How genes in modules overlap with each other?
* How our p-values correspond with theoretical ones?

---

## How to compare universes?

.pull-left[
* Most of the universes overlap for housekeeping genes
* Most of the obvious metrics to calculate overlap (like Jaccard Index) won't work
* We have to somehow weight genes
]

.pull-right[
<img src="gene_ranks.png" width="80%">
]

---

## TF-IDF

TF-IDF is term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency

* Genes are terms, we have $|U_0|$ terms
* $U_i$ are documents
* $tf(g, U_i) = 1$ if $g \in U_i$ and $0$ otherwise
* $idf(g) = log(\frac{N}{|\{U_i | g \in U_i\}|})$
* $tfidf(g, U_i) = tf(g, U_i) * idf(g)$

## Universe Network

.pull-left[
Plans:
* Redraw this one with newer database
* Identify what tissues (or cell types?) cliques represent
* Ideally, non cell-type specific pathways should not contribute to this network
]

.pull-right[
<img src="universe_network.png" width="80%">
]

---

## What can be interesting?

* How genes in universes overlap with each other?
* **How genes in modules overlap with each other?**
* How our p-values correspond with theoretical ones?

---


## Module sizes

.center[
<img src="module_sizes.png" width="90%">
]

---

## Module sizes

* Number of modules (clusters) kinda represent heterogeneity of the datasets
* More heterogeneous datasets will have more genes expressed
* Some modules are very small and chance to get any of these genes at random is very small

---

## Plans on modules

* Get the same networks for modules
* Identify cell types present in the network

---

## What can be interesting?

* How genes in universes overlap with each other?
* How genes in modules overlap with each other?
* **How our p-values correspond with theoretical ones?**

---

## Theoretical p values for random genes

* Null hypothesis, we query genes $Q$ by random
* If null hypothesis is true, then

$$ \forall i,j \ \ \  p(Q, M_{i, j}) \sim U[0, 1]$$

One of the most interesting features of such search is what the minimal p value reported for all genes?

$$ p\_{min}(Q) = \min\_{i, j} p(Q, M\_{i,j}) $$
$$ p(Q, M\_{i, j}) \sim U[0, 1] \implies p\_{min}(Q) \sim beta(M, 1)$$

---

## Empirical p-values against theoretical

.pull-left[
* Sample 100 and 1000 genes from $U_0$
* Query them
* Memorize minimal p value
* Repeat
]
.pull-right[
<img src="first_sampling.png" width="90%">
]

---

## Why we under-report p values

* $p(Q, M_{i, j}) \sim U[0, 1]$

## Why we under-report p values

.center[
<img src="distributions.gif" width="50%">
]

---

## Future plans for p-values

* Currently we select modules as markers that have p value adjusted less then 0.01
* We might consider lowering this threshold for p value 0.05 unadjusted to include more genes in the modules
* Ideally we have to investigate how p-value threshold affects the number of genes in the modules
* Maybe we could cluster samples differently?
* Can we model this differently? So far gene signature test seems to be very conservative

## Plans for publishing this one

4 figure paper:
* Dataset acquisition and processing
* Universe networks, features of universes
* Module networks, null modelling
* Cancer datasets study case
